## Hey, I'm Nathan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a product-focused fullstack developer with 10 years of professional experience and a 20-year journey in programming. My passion lies at the intersection of engineering and thoughtful user experience. I strive to build products that people love to use.

As a fullstack developer, I'm comfortable across the entire development spectrum but particularly enjoy:
- Building intuitive, responsive UIs that delight users
- Crafting clean, maintainable backend architectures
- Bridging the gap between design and development

## ðŸ”­ Current Focus

I'm currently exploring multiplayer game server design with Go and my latest product idea, [Tastador](https://tastador.com/).

Always learning, always building!
